# About me
I was enrolled in the Master 1 Advanced Networks and Optimization (former name of the current Master IoT) at Universit√© Paris-Saclay. As the name of the Master implied, I learned about Networks and Optimization, I also had the opportunity to study ML/AI.

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science.
